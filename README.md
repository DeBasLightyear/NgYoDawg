# NgYoDawg
An experiment in creating layers of Angular apps with separate styling and dependencies

## Step by step:
- Create outer Angular app;
- Create inner Angular app;
- Install npm packages and add them to angular.json for both layers (use aliases when the inner app needs different versions of packages);

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
